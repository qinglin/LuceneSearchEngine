○	Built a web crawler using the crawler4j API for crawling the domain of www.ics.uci.edu.
○	Created an index for the crawled web pages using Apache Lucene, and implemented the querying and scoring of the search engine, utilizing the TF-IDF and scoring formula of Lucene.
○	Designed a UI and integrated it with the search engine using the NetBeans IDE 7.3.
 
For the web crawler, We assumed that only html pages are processed. We do this to only retrieve tokens on HTML-parseable sites.
